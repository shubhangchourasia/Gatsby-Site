mission: Listen, iterate and deliver value by compounding.
coreValues: >-
  We believe all returns in life -- knowledge, wealth, and relationships -- come
  from compounding, so playing the long game is the secret of value creation. We
  always look for long-term value creation and mutual benefit in our customer,
  vendor, and employee relationship.


  We constantly remind ourselves and challenge each other with first principles thinking.


  We believe incremental and persistent value addition will yield great products & services.
