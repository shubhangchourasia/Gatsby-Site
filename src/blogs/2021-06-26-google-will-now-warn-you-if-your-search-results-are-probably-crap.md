Your Google searches for breaking news stories may now produce a surprising outcome: a warning that your results could be unreliable.

The company has started showing notifications for searches on emerging topics, which suggest that users return later when more information is available.

The notice is Google’s latest efforts to mitigate misinformation in search results for breaking news. In a blog posts[,](https://blog.google/products/search/new-notice-search-rapidly-evolving-results/) Danny Sullivan, public liaison for search at Google, said that sometimes reliable information isn’t online at the time that users search:

To help with this, we’ve trained our systems to detect when a topic is rapidly evolving and a range of sources hasn’t yet weighed in. We’ll now show a notice indicating that it may be best to check back later when more information from a wider range of sources might be available.
