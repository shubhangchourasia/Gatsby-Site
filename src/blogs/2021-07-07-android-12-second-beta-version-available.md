Android 12 has hit its next major milestone. Google has now released [the second beta](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-12-beta-2-1233493/) to the public, giving us access to a fresh new build of the OS. As with the previous beta and developer previews, this is still a very early version of the software, so we wouldn’t advise using it as your daily driver.

We can confirm, though, that Google is improving and introducing a host of facets in its latest iteration of Android. Tweaks to media handling and notification support, improvements to privacy and haptic feedback, and more polished notifications UI all make the cut. We’re barely brushing the surface here.

If you have a recent [Google Pixel](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-phones-835059/), you can [install Android 12](https://www.androidauthority.com/install-android-12-1201879/) on your device right now. It is also available for a select few devices [from other OEMs](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-12-beta-oem-1226802/).
